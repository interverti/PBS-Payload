 * FW13.42: a user reported OpenVideo=0x81950008, but did not provide the
 * request parameters or video-out mode. It has the same firmware-native
 * request layout as FW13.60 (verified against both memory dumps). Choose the
 * conservative profile regardless of an available video-out mode value,
 * pending hardware confirmation. Explicit 1440p/4K requests are unaffected.
 * FW10.01 is selected unconditionally because its supplied hardware log shows
 * the automatic 1440p request rejected on the first OpenVideo. The other pairs
 * are directly observed, not decoded HDR/4K enums. */
